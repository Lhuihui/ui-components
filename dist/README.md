# Watson Developer Cloud Components

This is a Bower Component for developing applications that use the Watson Design Guide patterns.


## Installation and Dependencies

You will need to make sure the icon-fonts are referenced properly.
The path of the icon-fonts must be relative to the path of the compiled css file.

You will also need to make sure to load the paths of your `bower_components` directory into your Sass configurations, so that the library can reference its bower_components dependencies properly.

The javascript of this library relies on `JQuery 1.12.4` and above.  Make sure it is
included before this library.
